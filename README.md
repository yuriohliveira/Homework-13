# Burger App

This project consists on working with handlebars and a database powered by jQuery and JavaScript. MySQL was used for the database. This app lets the user type a burger, save it to the database, and then eat it, by clicking at the devour button.

## Installation

To run and develop the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

In order to use this application as intended, you must have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

You must also install mysql (for database interaction), express-handlebars (for the HTML views), and Express (for running a server on your machine), which you can install by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars), and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). 

To get the database up and running, you can use the schema and the seeds provided. I used [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) with [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) as an editor.
